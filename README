This is a simple patch to nginx-0.8.52.

Assuming a setup where a response is proxied to a backend server, this patch
does a simple check of the Server header for one of two specific tokens.  If they are 
found the response is returned, otherwise the response is tossed.

Rationale:  Simple security/validation check that the backend is what you think it is.

TODO:  Put the patterns in a conf file (current hard-coded)
